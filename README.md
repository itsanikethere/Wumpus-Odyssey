# Wumpus Odyssey 🎮

Wumpus Odyssey is a game created using the Java Swing framework that challenges you to find the treasure while avoiding the dangers of the Wumpus and the Pit. The game features a consistent look and feel, thanks to the use of the Java Swing framework.

## How to Play 🕹️

The objective of the game is to find the treasure while avoiding the dangers of the single Wumpus and multiple pits that may be scattered throughout the grid of squares. The Wumpus can be located in any square of the grid, while the pits can be located in multiple squares. Squares adjacent to the Wumpus will emit a distinctive stench, whereas squares adjacent to the pits will produce a noticeable breeze.

To move to a square, simply left-click on it. To shoot an arrow in the hope of killing the Wumpus, right-click on the square. Note that you only have one arrow, so use it wisely! If you waste the arrow and encounter the Wumpus, it's game over.

Once you find the treasure, the game is over, and you do not need to return to the starting point.

## Installation 🛠️

To run Wumpus Odyssey, you have two options:

1. Download the JAR file and ensure that you have JRE version 20 or higher installed on your computer.
2. If you have Windows operating system, you can download the executable file (EXE) that I created using `jpackage` utility to make the installation process more user-friendly.

You can obtain both the JAR and EXE files in the [Releases](https://bit.ly/3nXyJ61) section.
